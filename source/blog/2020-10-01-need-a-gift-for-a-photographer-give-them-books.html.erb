<p>A question I get with some frequency is “what is a good gift I can get for my photographer friend/relative?” Gifts for photographers are tough; equipment is too specialized and expensive to be given as gifts, accessories requires you to know what equipment they already have, and photography-themed doodads like <a target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Improved-AM-MUG%C2%AE-226228-668-Button/dp/B00PF6GWBA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=gestevescom-20&linkId=4e917842fe17ffde3066ed791c6eff22&language=en_US">lens-shaped coffee mugs</a> are a waste of money that just end up collecting dust. Books, however, are a safer bet. Which photographer doesn’t love to look at photographs for inspiration? I’d never be upset receiving a cool photography book as a gift.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, here’s a list of all photography books I own and recommend. These are all currently sitting on my bookshelf, I’ve enjoyed each and every one of them and they’ve all inspired <a href="https://www.allencompassingtrip.com">my photography</a> in some way. I’ve sorted them by genre:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#landscape-wildlife-photography">Landscape & Wildlife Photography</a></li>
  <li><a href="#street-photography">Street Photography</a></li>
  <li><a href="#photography-how-to-guides">Photography How-To & Guides</a></li>
  <li><a href="#other">Other</a></li>
</ul>
